## Overview

This was a task made as a Quest from DevQuest, with the aim of exercising my JS habilities, mainly focused on using the github API. 

## The challenge

Create an online application that provides key information about GitHub users, such as:
  - User name;
  - Bio;
  - Profile photo;
  - Followers;
  - Following;
  - Repositories;
  - Repositories status;
  - Last events.

## My process

In this particular project, we built this application during the classes and add some new features as a challenge. When we talk about this task, the real deal was to manage the multiples endpoints, while writing a well-structured algorithm. 

To be honest, I found myself lost a few times while trying to assemble the HTML panels within Javascript and assign the data to new objects in the scripts. But in the end, and the help of others students, I manage to finish the quest.

## What I learned

In this particular project, I strengthened my understanding of consuming APIs using FETCH and ASYNC/AWAIT, while practicing more basic HTML and CSS concepts in a real-world situation.
